=== ChangeLog discontinued ===

 With the move to git, this module is switching from a ChangeLog file to
 relying on commit messages to provide change history. Please write commit
 messages in the following format:

=== begin example commit ===
Short explanation of the commit

Longer explanation explaining exactly what's changed, whether any
external or private interfaces changed, what bugs were fixed (with bug
tracker reference if applicable) and so forth. Be concise but not too brief.
=== end example commit ===

  - Always add a brief description of the commit to the _first_ line of
    the commit and terminate by two newlines (it will work without the
    second newline, but that is not nice for the interfaces).

  - First line (the brief description) must only be one sentence and
    should start with a capital letter unless it starts with a lowercase
    symbol or identifier. Don't use a trailing period either. Don't exceed
    72 characters.

  - The main description (the body) is normal prose and should use normal
    punctuation and capital letters where appropriate. Normally, for patches
    sent to a mailing list it's copied from there.

  - When committing code on behalf of others use the --author option, e.g.
    git commit -a --author "Joe Coder <joe@coder.org>" and --signoff.
