	* gnome-desktop-item.c:  Remove numeric canonization as it was
	  changing things and was likely having other effects besides that.
	  Also truncate the file after opening it before writing it.  Fixes
	  #84196

2002-07-12  Mark McLoughlin  <mark@skynet.ie>

	Apply modified version of a patch from Frank Worsley
	to make sure the 'easy' page is updated when editing

	we are editing.

2002-07-12  Mark McLoughlin  <mark@skynet.ie>

	* gnome-desktop-item.c: (type_from_string): be a bit
	smarter with strcmps, switch on the first letter and
	then compare.

2002-06-19  Arvind Samptur <arvind.samptur@wipro.com>

	* gnome-ditem-edit.c: (setup_option) Get the
	menuitem index and set the option menu with
	gtk_option_menu_set_history. Fixes #85782

2002-07-10  jacob berkman  <jacob@ximian.com>

	* gnome-desktop-item.c (gnome_desktop_item_new_from_uri):

2002-07-09  Mark McLoughlin  <mark@skynet.ie>

        * gnome-desktop-item.h, gnome-ditem-edit.c:
	Patch from Glynn Foster to use X-GNOME-DocPath
	instead of DocPath.  Fixes #87431.

2002-05-21  Jorn Baayen  <jorn@nl.linux.org>

Fri Apr 19 18:16:08 2002  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* gnome-desktop-item.c: Expand parameters before parse so that we
	  handle "%f" vs %f and such random fun.  Now we are likely very
	  similar to handling simple cases to KDE, though we handle quite
	  weird cases

	* test-ditem.c: add test cases.

Fri Apr 19 17:04:20 2002  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* gnome-desktop-item.c: For now ignore %m and %i.  This is broken,
	  and doesn't follow the spec but that's the only way to launch
	  all current KDE .desktops without breaking the spec.  This doesn't
	  fix the bug, just a temporary fix.  Perhaps it would be good if
	  both %m and %i just died, they are pretty useless to begin with.

Fri Apr 19 16:41:52 2002  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* gnome-ditem-edit.c: change the combo box to an option menu 1) this
	  has less weird semantics 2) only the standard types are allowed
	  here anyway.  Though we handle editting of files with a
	  non-standard type, just not creating one.

2002-04-15  Kjartan Maraas  <kmaraas@gnome.org>

	* gnome-ditem.edit.c: Add a call to bindtextdomain() to make it work
	in the case where you right click on something in a menu and edit it.
	Also makes localization work for the same right click menu.
	
Fri Apr 12 14:08:36 2002  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* gnome-ditem-edit.c: partly fix #75379, by changing the exec

Fri Apr 12 13:17:21 2002  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

Wed Mar 27 19:59:11 2002  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* gnome-ditem-edit.c: some UI tweaks and fixes.  Fix the front page,
	  make the advanced page less wide by squishing the
	  translated name/comment/generic name fields.  Also reverse the
	  order of the thingies in the popdown combo thing.

Wed Mar 27 10:39:24 2002  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* gnome-desktop-item.[ch], gnome-ditem-edit.c: add generic name

2002-03-27  Mark McLoughlin  <mark@skynet.ie>

	* gnome-ditem-edit.c:
	(translations_add): create the tree with a list model so as
	to not spew warnings. Random cleanups.

2002-02-20  Darin Adler  <darin@bentspoon.com>

	* gnome-desktop-item.h:
	* gnome-desktop-item.c: (readbuf_getc): Handle case where you try
	to keep reading and the handle is NULL by treating it as EOF. This
	is also the case at the end of the string. Set a new
	"past_first_read" flag, used to optimize rewinding for the vast
	majority of desktop files that fit entirely in the buffer.
	(readbuf_gets): More g_return_if_fail.
	(readbuf_open): Add a GError parameter, and include the
	GnomeVFSResult in the error. Allocate the buf, which is now a
	separate object.
	(readbuf_new_from_string): New function, which creates a readbuf
	from an existing string.
	(readbuf_rewind): Reset eof and pos to make this actually work.
	Check the past_first_read flag to avoid re-reading if the entire
	file fits in the buffer. Reset size to trigger a read if we decide
	to re-read the buffer. Make it try to reopen the file instead of
	just malfunctioning if the GnomeVFSFileHandle is already NULL.
	(readbuf_close): Free the buf if needed.
	(read_sort_order): Pass NULL for GError * to readbuf_open.
	(gnome_desktop_item_new_from_uri): Use the GnomeVFSResult for the
	error code, rather than errno. Get rid of unneeded
	gnome_vfs_file_info_clear just before gnome_vfs_file_info_unref.
	Use the new readbuf_open, since ditem_load now takes a ReadBuf *
	instead of a URI.
	(gnome_desktop_item_new_from_string): New.
	(get_encoding): Do the check for valid UTF-8 as we read the file
	rather than re-reading it again at the end. Also get the URI from
	the ReadBuf rather than passing it separately for the "guess by
	location" hack, which is not really necessary, since the validate
	heuristic will get it right anyway. Also handle the case of a NULL
	URI properly.
	(setup_type): Rename filename to uri to make it clearer what's
	really going on here.
	(sanitize): Handle the case of a NULL URI. Also add a fallback
	name for the case where you have neither a URI nor a name in the
	file. Also fix a storage leak.
	(ditem_load): Take a ReadBuf * parameters instead of a URI, so we
	can share this between the file and non-file cases. Also fix an
	error format string to avoid segfault.
	(ditem_save): Share the error handling code for gnome_vfs_open
	and gnome_vfs_create since they did the same thing. Also change
	to use GnomeVFSResult instead of errno.

	* gnome-desktop-item.c: actually make looking for kde icons work,
	  and don't check the kde stuff if we've already found a gnome one,
	  also ignore dot directories to avoid infinite loops and such.

Wed Dec 19 18:34:00 2001  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

Wed Dec 19 18:23:17 2001  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* gnome-desktop-item.[ch]: add a find_icon function which
	  doesn't work only on desktop items but no matter how you got the
	  icon name.  Also deal with sizes and only look in kde hicolor
	  dirs.

2001-12-16  Gediminas Paulauskas <menesis@delfi.lt>

	* gnome-desktop/gnome-ditem-edit.c: get translations from
	GETTEXT_PACKAGE domain and with UTF-8 codeset, so that translations
	work when library is used outside of gnome-core.

Fri Dec 14 16:43:23 2001  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* gnome-desktop-item.c: simplify and complete the %? substitution.
	  Now %f and friends behave in a more predictable way.  If there
	  are multiple instances on the command line you get the
	  same file.  This also fixes other corner cases and simplifies what
	  we do.  It's also more predictable, and makes more sense.  Things
	  may still be weird if you use both %u and %f on the same line,
	  but then you deserve what you get.

Fri Dec 14 15:58:06 2001  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* gnome-desktop-item.[ch], gnome-ditem-edit.[ch]: added some needed

	Return "MIXED_ENCODING" when we aren't sure

	* gnome-desktop-item.[ch]: use g_find_program_in_path and

	Stop including gnome-vfs-mime.h, use gnome-vfs-mime-util.h instead.

	* gnome-desktop-item.c: (gnome_desktop_item_new_from_uri),

	and gnome_vfs_file_info_unref.

Wed Nov 07 00:52:47 2001  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* gnome-desktop-item.[ch]: Port to GnomeVFS.  Compiles, if
	  it actually works is a different question altogether.  However
	  it should still work and shouldn't break anything.  (Breaks
	  get/set_location api since that's uri and not filename now)

2001-10-25  Mark McLoughlin  <mark@skynet.ie>

	* gnome-hint.h: sync gnome_hint_new def.

2001-10-25 Stephen Browne <stephen.browne@sun.com?

	* gnome-desktop-item.c (escape_string_and_dup,
	escape_string_and_dup):
	Don't write past end of string.

2001-10-09  Havoc Pennington  <hp@redhat.com>

	* gnome-desktop-item.c (gnome_desktop_item_new): create the hash
	table here, since we use it and assume it's always non-nul

Wed Sep 26 23:04:04 2001  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* gnome-ditem-edit.[ch]:  Add a _set_editable call which makes

	  a stupid implementation.

2001-09-25  Darin Adler  <darin@bentspoon.com>

	* gnome-desktop-item.c: (gnome_desktop_item_launch): Update
	calls for change in gnome_url_show API.

Fri Sep 21 12:14:06 2001  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* gnome-desktop-item.h: include gobject/gtype.h

	* gnome-ditem-edit.[ch]: include evil api to grab focus, to be
	  replaced by a correct way to do this in the future.

2001-09-21  Glynn Foster <glynn.foster@sun.com>

	* test-ditem.c: (test_ditem): Fix up this to pass the right 
	  number of args to gnome_desktop_item_get_type () and 
          gnome_desktop_item_set_localestring ()

Thu Sep 20 16:38:11 2001  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* gnome-desktop-item.[ch]: make sure name/encoding/version are set,
	  location return is now const, and some better checks.  Also fix
	  saving 'under' and some 'modified' logic

	* gnome-ditem-edit.h: fix comment

Thu Sep 20 15:15:54 2001  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* gnome-desktop-item.[ch]: string vector const weirdness removed

Wed Sep 19 01:42:13 2001  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* gnome-desktop-item.c, gnome-ditem-edit.c: eeek, exported an
	  internal function.

Tue Sep 18 23:11:33 2001  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* gnome-desktop-item.[ch]: Few more accessors, whack the push/pop
	  of sections.  Keys can now include sections, add actual error
	  returns

	* gnome-ditem-edit.[ch]: whack crack entries, make compile, and port
	  to new desktop item.

	* Makefile.am: add the ditem-edit

Sat Sep 08 01:55:29 2001  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* All bonobo stuff.  Removed for now.  This is in bonobo somewhere
	  now anyway.

	* Makefile.am: Fixup for the current no-bonobo build

	* gnome-desktop-item.[ch], test-ditem.c:  Made loading/saving work
	  and add tests

	* gnome-ditem-edit.[ch]: Add this, currently the same version that
	  was the last working one in libgnomeui HEAD.  Doesn't compile nor
	  work with the ditem yet.

Fri Sep 07 21:43:34 2001  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* gnome-desktop-item.[ch]: Put the parser into the ditem, completely
	  reshuffle the API, make it be much more anal about how it reads
	  files, simplify internal storage, and follow the spec more closely,
	  not api nor implementation complete.  Still needs a lot of work.
	  A .desktop moniker should rather be based upon this API rather
	  then being beneath it.  However that's very low on my priority list
	  right now.  But it should be simpler then before I'd think, and
	  you'd get actual spec compliant reading/writing.

Tue Sep 04 23:06:06 2001  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* Makefile.am, gnome-desktop-item.[ch]: Mostly stubify things with
	  #if 0's just to make it compile.  I will be changing the whole
	  structure of this shortly and simplifying the interface a lot
	  it seems to have grown quite a bit.

2001-08-21  Martin Baulig  <baulig@suse.de>

	* bonobo-config-ditem.c (get_encoding): If we can't determine the encoding,
	suck the whole file in and pipe it through g_utf8_validate().
	(encode_string): Never return NULL, instead use CORBA_string_dup ("").
	(bonobo_config_ditem_write_key): Deal with GNOME::LocalizedStringList.
	(bonobo_config_ditem_load): Correctly deal with newlines and wide unicode
	chars on legacy-mixed encoded files.

2001-08-20  Martin Baulig  <baulig@suse.de>

	* Makefile.am, bonobo-config-ditem.c: Disable dmalloc again. Hmm, for the
	moment it seems to work - let's see how long this lasts.

2001-08-20  Martin Baulig  <baulig@suse.de>

	* Makefile.am: Compile and install bonobo-moniker-ditem.

	* bonobo-moniker-ditem.c: Make this a stand-alone server, not a shared
	library.

	* Bonobo_Moniker_ditem.server.in.in: Renamed from Bonobo_Moniker_ditem.oaf.in.

	* bonobo-config-ditem.[ch]: Require dmalloc.

2001-08-20  Martin Baulig  <baulig@suse.de>

	* gnome-desktop-item.c (GnomeDesktopItem): Added `name', `comment'
	and `attributes' hash tables; copy all the CORBA sequences into these
	hash tables to make the lookup faster.

	* gnome-desktop-item.h: Make all `GnomeDesktopItem *'s non-const.

2001-08-20  Martin Baulig  <baulig@suse.de>

	* gnome-desktop-i18n.[ch]: New files. This is a mixture of the old
	gnome-libs/libgnome/gnome-i18n.c and gettext-0.10.38/intl/localealias.c.

	* locale.alias: New file. From gettext-0.10.38.

	* Makefile.am: Install locale.alias in $(datadir)/gnome.

2001-08-20  Martin Baulig  <baulig@suse.de>

	* bonobo-config-ditem.[ch]: Merge bonobo-config-ditem-internals.[ch]
	back into this file.

	* bonobo-config-ditem-internals.[ch]: Removed.

2001-08-20  Martin Baulig  <baulig@suse.de>

	* Makefile.am: For the moment, link test-ditem against dmalloc.
	I don't know what this is, but it crashes in malloc() without
	dmalloc, but I have dmalloc turned off .... :-(

	* gnome-desktop.xmldb: Removed, don't need this anymore.

2001-08-20  Martin Baulig  <baulig@suse.de>

	Rewrote the ditem code a bit, cleaned up its API and give the
	gnome-desktop-item.c code direct access to its internals.

	* bonobo-config-ditem-internals.[ch]: New files.

	* bonobo-config-ditem.[ch]: Moved a few functions to the new
	bonobo-config-ditem-internals.[ch].

2001-08-18  Martin Baulig  <baulig@suse.de>

	* gnome-desktop-item.c (gnome_desktop_item_get_tryexec):
	New function.

2001-08-17  Martin Baulig  <baulig@suse.de>

	* Makefile.am: Include bonobo-config-ditem.[ch] and
	bonobo-config-ditem-utils.[ch] in the library.

	* gnome-desktop-item.c: Call the code from bonobo-config-ditem.c
	directly rather than via the moniker.

2001-08-17  Martin Baulig  <baulig@suse.de>

	* gnome-ditem.[ch]: Renamed to gnome-desktop-item.[ch].

2001-08-12  Martin Baulig  <baulig@suse.de>

	* gnome-ditem.h (gnome_desktop_item_get_location): Make
	the return value non-const.

2001-08-06  Martin Baulig  <baulig@suse.de>

	* gnome-ditem.[ch]: Fix #includes for the new location.

	* Makefile.am: New file.
