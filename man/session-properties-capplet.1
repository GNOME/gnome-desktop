.SH NAME
session-properties-capplet \- control what programs are started at login time.
.SH SYNOPSIS

\fBsession-properties-capplet\fR [ \fB --warner \fR ]

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
\fBsession-properties-capplet\fR allows you to control what programs
are started at login time. Gnome has the concept of session
management. In simple terms, it means that you can save your "session"
(that is, information about currently working applications, their
status and position on the screen) at any stage, and at your next
login the same applications will reappear on your screen in the same
positions, allowing you to continue your work. Note, however, this
only works for Gnome compliant applications.
.PP
Gnome also provides another way of starting applications at login. 
You can explicitly specify one or more commands to run, and Gnome will
execute them at login in addition to the applications from your saved
session. This works for all kinds of applications, whether Gnome
compliant or not.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.TP
\fB--warner\fR
Only display warnings.
