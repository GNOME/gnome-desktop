.TH "SESSION-PROPERTIES" "1" "10 februar 2002" "" ""
.SH NAME
session-properties \- a non-CORBA version of the session-properties-capplet.
.SH SYNOPSIS

\fBsession-properties\fR [ \fB --init-session-settings \fR ] [ \fB --warner \fR ]

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
\fBsession-properties\fR monitors the state of current GNOME
running applications and capplets. It allows you to change the style
and priority of each program. You can shut down applications, if you
wish, and those applications will be removed from your GNOME session.
You can also use Session Properties to kill a GNOME application and
remove it from session management so it will not be restarted when you
log in next time. Of course, there are other ways to kill an
application, such as using an explicit kill command, but they would
not prevent an application from being restarted if it has the Respawn
Style. The only way to permanently remove such an application is with
the Remove button.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.TP
\fB--init-session-settings\fR
Initialize session settings.
.TP
\fB--warner\fR
Only display warnings.
