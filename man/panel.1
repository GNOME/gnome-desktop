.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
\fBpanel\fR The GNOME Panel is the heart of the
GNOME user interface and acts as a repository for the Main Menu, user
menus, application launchers, applets (applications which run entirely
within the panel), drawers, and several special objects. The Panel was
designed to be highly configurable. You can easily customize its
behavior and appearance and add or remove objects to suite your
personal needs and preferences. You can even have multiple panels, each
with its own appearance, properties, and contents. This flexibility
allows you to easily create a comfortable and efficient personalized
desktop environment.
